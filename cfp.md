In 2026, we celebrate 50 years since the first interdisciplinary conference on humor, held in Cardiff, Wales – a landmark and a decisive step in the later creation of the International Society for Humor Studies. During all these years, the ISHS has consolidated its role as the primary venue for humor scholarship, and, of course, a place for discussion, interaction and exchange for humor scholars.

This year, for the first time ever, the conference will be held in South America – Federal Fluminense University (UFF in the Portuguese acronym) will host the event in campus Gragoatá, in the city of Niterói, state of Rio de Janeiro. 

The ISHS welcomes papers from the countless fields of human knowledge that deal with humor, including psychology, linguistics, social sciences, anthropology, computational sciences, engineering, education, communication, robotics, law, translation, folklore, among others. 

Please submit an abstract of up to 250 words and a brief biography by January 30, 2026, by registering now using the button below.
