Nestled along Guanabara Bay, at the back end of the Gragoatá Campus of UFF, the Institute of Art and Social Communication (IACS in the Portuguese acronym), which houses the Graduate Program in Communication, is a recent building, composed of eleven two-story blocks, being the largest unit in terms of square footage and the second largest in terms of number of courses and students. The IACS houses 10 undergraduate courses and 6 graduate ones. The Graduate Program in Communication has been in existence for over 25 years and is considered one of the most important programs in the area in Brazil.

The IACS building provides stunning views of the Rio de Janeiro skyline. Just a short walk from the city center of Niterói, the Gragoatá Campus blends academic life with the laid-back coastal vibe that defines the region. Niterói itself is a gem, known for its high quality of life. The city offers beautiful beaches such as Itacoatiara and Icaraí, as well as architectural highlights such as Oscar Niemeyer’s Contemporary Art Museum (MAC), one of the most iconic buildings of Brazilian modernism, which stands out in the coastal landscape like a flying saucer. The area around the campus is vibrant, filled with local eateries and an intense bohemian life, driven by the students.

A short ferry ride across the bay connects downtown Rio with the heart of Niterói, offering one of the region’s most breathtaking views. There is also a land connection between the two cities via the Rio-Niterói Bridge, which allows one to travel between the two metropolitan areas by bus or car. Once in Niterói, much of the city’s economy is driven by the university itself, which welcomes students from various parts of the country and especially from municipalities in the interior of the state of Rio de Janeiro. Historically, during the period when the city of Rio de Janeiro was the capital of Brazil, before the creation of Brasília in the 1960s, Niterói was, in turn, the fluminense capital, that is, the capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro.

Finally, it is worth noting that the connection between the two cities is so intense that they compete together in a single bid to host the Pan American Games in 2031, the most important multi-sport event for athletes from nations on the American continent. For international visitors, this geographic and cultural proximity allows them to experience the best of both cities, combining Rio’s bustling energy with Niterói’s more tranquil, welcoming atmosphere.
