For more than 30 years, the conferences organized by the International Society for Humor Studies have been the primary venue to present scientific research in the field of humor studies. The ISHS welcomes papers from the numerous expertises, such as social sciences, communication and media studies, anthropology, political science, history, psychology, education, linguistics and translation, folklore, computational sciences and engineering, robotics, law, among others. 

Individual paper proposals can be made by submitting short abstracts. Submitted proposals will be reviewed by the local organizing committee and by ad hoc experts in the field, and, if approved, will be assembled into panels specifically designed by the organization or will eventually join the panels proposed by other scholars in response to the call for panels.

Each proponent is responsible for gathering all the necessary information for the submission. Please submit a 250-word short abstract to the form that will be provided in the conference's website. In case of any doubt, please write to the conference convenors at humorstudies@midia.uff.br

The proposal must include:

* Title.

* A 250-word short abstract.

* List of respective authors and their mini-bios. All authors must have agreed to submit their abstracts to the panel. Authors must also register beforehand to the conference separately.

Papers with more than one author are allowed, but, if the paper is approved, all of them must have paid the registration fee for the conference.

No remote presentations will be allowed. There will be a special webinar, prior to the main conference, completely online, dedicated for works about the Global South or written by Global South scholars.

For papers that are part of pre-organized panels, the submission is made directly by the panel proposer. In this case, individual paper proposers should not submit their proposals in duplicate. Authors of short abstracts are also allowed to submit panels and roundtables proposals, if they so wish. However, authors of short abstracts may submit a maximum of two paper proposals, with only one as the main author.

Please submit your proposal by March 27, 2026, using the button below.
