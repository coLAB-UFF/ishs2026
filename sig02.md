The ISHS SIG for Humor and Artificial Intelligence, based at the Semantic Artificial Intelligence and Creativity Lab at Texas A&M University–Commerce, aims to bring together researchers and practitioners for the purposes of fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, facilitating access to resources, and promoting innovation and rigor in research into computational humor. The SIG organizes a recurring panel at the ISHS Conference and holds fortnightly online meetings. Ongoing work includes establishing a web presence; producing a running survey of computational humor publications, software, and data sets; and organizing workshops, tutorials, and other events aimed at community building and cross-disciplinary transfer of practical skills and theoretical knowledge.
