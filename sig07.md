This SIG's mission is to highlight the study of how humor and comedy do and do not travel across different languages and cultures when an attempt is made to adapt them from a source to a target context. Our SIG's main objective is to offer a platform for interdisciplinary research, by fostering connections and synergies among scholars in the fields of humor studies and translation studies, by supporting exchanges of ideas among members, and by showcasing their research through online events open to both academics and the general public.
