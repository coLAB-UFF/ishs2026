The Business and Media SIG brings together academic and business leaders who have a shared interest in understanding how humor is used within commercial settings. How humor is placed within a commercial setting has been widely studied. Spotts et al. (1997) stated that up to 30% of all US advertising spend is focused on messages with a humorous content. The Business and Media SIG will seek to understand these drivers and create a forum whereby business leaders and academics can understand the latest trends and developments in the use of humor, thereby driving academic study into the subject. The Business and Media SIG brings together business leaders and academics on a regular basis to explore areas of mutual understanding and exchange knowledge. The Business and Media SIG will further work to improve the understanding of the changing challenges of how media and business use and engage with humor, for example, in relation to trans rights, the LGBTQ community, and race relations.
