His research expertise lies in Political Communication, particularly at the intersection of political culture and digital culture, humor, and democracy, among other topics. He leads the Research Laboratory in Communication, Political Cultures, and Collaborative Economy (coLAB/UFF) and coordinates the university extension project #MUSEUdeMEMES.</p>
  <p>Chagas is also the author and editor of the collections A Cultura dos Memes (2020) and A Cultura dos Memes no Brasil (2024), both published by Edufba, as well as more than 60 articles in national and international scientific journals and 20 book chapters.

  <p>Regarding scientific event organization, Chagas has experience as principal investigator, member of organizing committees, and scientific committees on various occasions. He was the main organizer of the #MUSEUdeMEMES Symposium+Exhibition, held in 2019 at the Catete Palace, Museum of the Republic, which brought together over 200 participants, including national and international researchers. This was the first large-scale event dedicated to debates on meme studies. The symposium ran concurrently with an exhibition displayed in four rooms of the palace from April to September of that year, extended twice due to public demand, and attracted more than 8,000 visitors. The event received financial support from Capes (PAEP call) and CNPq (Universal call).</p>
  <p>Chagas also organized the online panel series Circuito de Formação sobre Meio Ambiente e Desinformação, promoted by the Brazilian Political Science Association (ABCP) in 2022.

Earlier, he was part of the organizing committee of the 4th Compolítica Meeting in 2011 at UERJ.
