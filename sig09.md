The Performing Comedy SIG is dedicated to ISHS members who are involved and/or interested in the comedy-creating process. This includes performers, writers, directors, producers, and animators that work in any artistic medium, genre, or style. We aim to build an international community that connects comedy practitioners and humor researchers interested in collaboration.
