This SIG aims at fostering discussions, research collaborations, and methodological innovation around the multimodal study of interactional humor. To do so, the SIG brings together a diverse group of scholars in online and face-to-face meetings, to facilitate the exchange of ideas, call for papers, publications, events, etc. To help members explore new research approaches and instruments, we will organize virtual and in-person events such as methodological workshops and talks, panels and work-in-progress talks. To facilitate the dissemination of findings and support research in multimodality and interactional humor across countries, we will build an online collaborative library for members to share publications or research instruments and access publications free of charge.
