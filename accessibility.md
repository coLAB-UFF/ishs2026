The IACS building's interior spaces feature various accessibility features for people with disabilities. Tactile flooring in the corridors provides guidance for blind people.

The blocks all have two floors, with wide corridors to accommodate wheelchair access. There is also an elevator near the main entrance for people with mobility difficulties.
