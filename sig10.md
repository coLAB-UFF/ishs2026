The mission of our group is to promote and advance the study of humor in cinema, television, streaming, and other media. We see this as a vehicle for those engaged in these related fields to communicate with one another and to support collaborative work between our members and the ISHS membership at large. In the service of this mission, the SIG will

•	Highlight key issues within our fields and bring them to the awareness of the ISHS community through special panels at the annual conference.

•	Promote the inclusion of screen comedy research by conducting virtual meetings on selected topics. These may include informal discussions among members as well as presentations that focus on specific topics and readings.

•	Promote the inclusion of screen comedy scholarship in the ISHS newsletter and in Humor: International Journal of Humor Research.

•	Provide a venue for sharing pedagogical practices for courses in screen comedy.
