<h2>Student awards</h2>

There are four awards available:

1.	ISHS Graduate Student Awards (GSA): to recognize outstanding scholars and promising graduate students conducting research in humor studies.

2.	The Don and Alleen Nilsen Young Scholars Award (DANYS): to inspire young scholars to prepare high quality presentations for the annual ISHS Conferences. The judges look for such qualities as originality, value to the field of humor studies, accuracy of information, and skill in presentation.

3.	Christie Davies Award (CDA): to recognize exemplary graduate student work presented at ISHS Conferences on any topic within the area of social sciences or liberal arts disciplines.

4.	Brazilian Portuguese Special Student Awards: to recognize outstanding scholars conducting research in humor studies in Brazil.
