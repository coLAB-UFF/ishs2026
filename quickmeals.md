UFF’s Gragoatá Campus features several small cafeterias spread across its academic buildings. Popular choices include Cantina da Maura and Maia Restaurante. There are also affordable off-campus options nearby. The quickest alternatives can be found at Cantareira Square, located right in front of the university’s main entrance.

Cantareira Square is a well-known bohemian spot in Niterói, popular among students and locals alike. There you’ll find food trucks and casual bars that are perfect for socializing with friends. For a more upscale experience, the Reserva complex offers restaurants serving gourmet snacks, pizzas, and artisanal sandwiches.
