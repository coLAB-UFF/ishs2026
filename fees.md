Because of UFF’s historical commitment to social equality and the personal convictions of the conference convenors, the ISHS 2026 adopted distinct registration fees for Majority and Minority World scholars. In addition to maintaining lower fees for undergraduate students, delegates from low and middle-income countries (aka Majority World) must pay less, reflecting the unequal financing conditions that scholars from these regions face.

Until now, delegates from the Majority World have paid the same registration fees as those from the Minority World, despite the clear economic disparities between them. Inflation and unfavorable exchange rates between Global South or Majority World currencies and the US dollar often make these fees amount to up to one-fifth of a scholar’s monthly income. This is an unsustainable and exclusionary practice. Recent conferences have showcased, for the first time, researchers from countries such as Zimbabwe, revealing the intellectual richness and originality that emerge when voices from the Global South are heard. 

Hybrid formats, as implemented in Krakow (2025) and Boston (2023), have proven both feasible and impactful. Many scholars from the Global South can only join online, and excluding them through in-person-only policies contradicts the Society’s inclusive mission.

In view of these considerations, the fees charged to participate in the ISHS 2026 conference will be as follows:

| Category                        | Fee (USD) |
| ------------------------------- | --------- |
| ISHS Member                     | **200**   |
| ISHS Non-Member                 | **250**   |
| Undergraduate Student           | **150**   |
| Majority World Non-Member (in-person) | **150**   |
| Majority World Member (in-person) | **100**   |
| Majority World Undergraduate Student (in-person) | **75**   |
| Majority World Member (online, limited vacancies)    | **50**    |
