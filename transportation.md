Traveling between Niterói and Rio de Janeiro is straightforward, with multiple public transportation and shuttle options. Most visitors arrive via Rio de Janeiro–Galeão International Airport (GIG) or Santos Dumont Airport (SDU). From either airport, you can reach Niterói by taxi, ride-sharing apps, shuttle services, or public transport.

**Ferry (Barca)**: The ferry is a scenic and popular way to cross Guanabara Bay. Ferries depart from Praça XV in Rio to Praça Arariboia in Niterói, taking about 20 minutes. Tickets cost R$5. Payment can be made in cash, but it’s often easier to use a rechargeable transit card or the official ferry app. More info: [Barcas S.A](https://barcasrio.com.br/).

**VLT (Light Rail)**: In Rio, the VLT connects downtown, Santos Dumont Airport, and the port area. Fares are R$4.70 per ride. Cash is not accepted on board, so passengers must use the Bilhete Único card (or Riocard) or a mobile app. Learn more: [Rio VLT](https://trilhos.motiva.com.br/vltrio/).

**Metro**: Rio’s metro links neighborhoods such as Copacabana, Ipanema, and Barra da Tijuca. Single tickets cost R$7.90. Payment is only accepted via the Bilhete Único card (or Riocard), Jaé municipal card or app.

**Buses**: Both Rio and Niterói have extensive bus networks. Fares are around R$4.70 in Rio and R$4.05 in Niterói. Some buses accept cash, but many require prepaid cards or transit apps. Check routes and fares previously.

**Shuttles, taxis, and ride-sharing apps**: Shuttles from the airports are available but may need prior booking. Taxis and ride-sharing apps such as Uber are widely available. A ride from Santos Dumont Airport to Niterói costs roughly R$70–90 and takes 20–40 minutes depending on traffic.

**Jaé vs Riocard**: For public transport in Niterói and Rio, there are two main reusable cards: Jaé is mainly for Rio and Niterói buses, while Riocard works for buses, ferries, and metro in Rio. Visitors can load them with money at stations, authorized retailers, or via mobile apps. Using these cards simplifies transfers and avoids needing cash for each ride.
