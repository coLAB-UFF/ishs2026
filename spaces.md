IACS features a spacious and pleasant outdoor area along the shores of Guanabara Bay, offering visitors a relaxing environment between activities. The 11-block complex also includes open indoor areas. Some of the building’s rooms can be occasionally used for receptions, registration, multilateral meetings, web conferences, and similar purposes.

Regarding the opening ceremony, depending on the number of participants expected, it is possible to hold the inauguration in an external venue, as was done during the conference of the National Association of Graduate Programs in Communication, as mentioned above. This is because neither the institute nor the campus has an auditorium for more than 250 seats. Nevertheless, the history of previous events indicates that arranging such external venues is relatively straightforward. In any case, if the keynote speeches and opening ceremony require an auditorium with 150-200 seats, there are facilities on the campus itself that can accommodate this capacity.

For book launches and cocktail receptions, the institute has an exhibition gallery that is well suited for such purposes. Additionally, the gallery—located approximately 50 to 100 meters from the main building—can simultaneously host a photography or multimedia exhibition, thereby enriching the conference program over the remaining days.

The institute can provide 10 medium-sized classrooms for concurrent sessions, each accommodating around 40 participants. Smaller rooms, seating 20 to 30 people, are also available, including a computer lab equipped with 15 workstations (both desktops and laptops), which can serve as an operational hub for the team of monitors and the local organizing committee. Should the conference include an audiovisual exhibition, the institute also offers suitable facilities to accommodate these needs.
