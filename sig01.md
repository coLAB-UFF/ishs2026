This SIG studies humor that emerges in online contexts. The internet has increasingly become a venue for generating and reproducing humor. It has had an impact on the content and form of humor, the ways it spreads, and as well as on the reception of humorous messages. The SIG addresses important questions like the globalization / localization of humor, interactional aspects (e.g. asynchronicity) and metapragmatics of creating and sharing humor, the relationship between humor and hate speech, different genres of online humor, etc. The group aims at connecting researchers from different countries and disciplinary backgrounds. The collaboration within the group is focused on developing new interdisciplinary methodologies and giving an impulse to initiate joint research projects. The group welcomes everyone interested in online humor, and encourages students and early career researchers to join.
