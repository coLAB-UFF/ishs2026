The "Global South", although made of a complex collection of peoples and nations across different continents, share common historical, social, and political patterns of underrepresentation, exploitation, and marginalisation. These issues have been addressed by an emerging production of humor scholarship developed from and/or about the Global South. However, this production is currently dispersed, as it has not yet been articulated in a common research framework tailored around Global South contexts. This group aims to bring together researchers who are developing theoretical or empirical research about humor in the Global South. It will be a privileged space to discuss the specificities of humor in peripheral countries, to identify key research gaps, and to propose pathways for further study. Our mission will be to introduce, debate and broaden analyses of humorous expressions produced by or referring to actors of the Global South.
