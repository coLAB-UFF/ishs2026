Most international visitors arrive in Rio de Janeiro through Rio de Janeiro–Galeão International Airport (GIG – also known as Tom Jobim Airport). This airport handles most long-haul flights from North America, Europe, and Asia. A smaller number of travelers may also arrive at Santos Dumont Airport (SDU), which mainly serves domestic flights or connections from other Brazilian cities.

From Galeão Airport, you have several options to reach Niterói. The fastest is by taxi or app-based ride services, which take approximately 40 to 60 minutes depending on traffic. Public buses also run from the airport to Niterói, but this option may require transfers and take 1.5 to 2 hours. If you arrive at Santos Dumont, Niterói is closer, usually 25 to 40 minutes by taxi or ride-share.

Most travelers cross to Niterói via the Rio–Niterói Bridge, a major highway connecting the two cities. During rush hours (typically 7–10 a.m. and 5–8 p.m.), the bridge can experience heavy traffic, so it’s best to plan extra time if traveling during these periods.

Upon arrival at Brazilian airports, you will go through immigration and customs. For many countries, visitors can enter Brazil visa-free for up to 90 days, but it’s important to check current visa requirements in advance. Expect basic security and document checks, which can take from 20 minutes to over an hour, depending on flight schedules and passenger volume.

Once in Niterói, taxis, ride-sharing apps, and public buses can easily take you to hotels or conference venues. The city is compact and navigable, offering a safe and scenic introduction to Brazilian culture, with views of the Guanabara Bay and Rio skyline along the way.
