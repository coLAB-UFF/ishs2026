The SIG in Humour and Education aims to promote and advance the understanding and application of humour in education, through researcher, educator, practitioner and student collaboration, combining rigorous research with creative practice across diverse disciplines, cultures and contexts. Objectives include:

To facilitate the exchange of research findings, pedagogical strategies and case studies that demonstrate the effective use of humour in education

To promote interdisciplinary dialogue on how humour influences cognitive, social, emotional and biological factors associated with teaching, learning and education

To encourage and support collaborative research projects, publications and conference presentations related to humour and education

To provide a platform for professional development, networking and mentoring for individuals working in or studying in this field.
