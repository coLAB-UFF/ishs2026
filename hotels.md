With a population of approximately 500,000 inhabitants, Niterói is considered a medium-sized city by Brazilian standards. It boasts a well-developed hospitality network, with numerous hotels located relatively close to the university. Unfortunately, UFF does not provide accommodations for visitors, as its student housing requires prior registration and operates with a waiting list. Nevertheless, the city offers a wide range of lodging options. A selection of recommended hotels is listed below.
